# MUNCH
A combination of "match" and "lunch," a lunch tag matching web application designed to revolutionize the way Yale students connect over meals. Drawing inspiration from the Donut feature on Slack, MUNCH simplifies the lunch tag process by offering an integrated platform, replacing the fragmented systems of GroupMe, Facebook groups, and emails.
