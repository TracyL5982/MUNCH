MUNCH, a combination of "match" and "lunch," is a lunch tag matching web application designed to revolutionize the way Yale students connect over meals. Drawing inspiration from the Donut feature on Slack, MUNCH simplifies the lunch tag process by offering an integrated platform, replacing the fragmented systems of GroupMe, Facebook groups, and emails.

MUNCH primarily caters to Yale students eager to socialize over meals and the hardworking administrators who oversee lunch tag setups. These students, in search of camaraderie and new connections, often find themselves navigating through a labyrinth of messages and emails. MUNCH streamlines this experience, making lunch tag matching a breeze.

While lunch tags have become an integral part of the Yale club culture, their execution remains cumbersome due to reliance on multiple platforms. Important notifications get buried under heaps of emails, while coordinating across different apps can be confusing and time-consuming. MUNCH aims to offer a one-stop solution to these challenges, centralizing the lunch tag process for enhanced user experience.

**Key Features:**
* Classrooms/Feeds: Create unique virtual spaces for each club or organization. These can be termed "feeds" to give a modern touch. Each feed will be managed by a moderator responsible for reassignments and other administrative tasks.
* Intelligent Matching: Implement an algorithm that pairs members within a club or organization, ensuring diverse interactions.
* Reminders: Automated reminders will be sent to let users know of their matches and encourage them to meet. This includes the ability to share icebreakers, enhancing initial interactions.
* Profiles: Allow users to set up detailed profiles within each feed, enhancing the personal touch and improving the matching process.
* Milestones & Rewards: Encourage consistent participation by introducing milestones. As members complete more lunch tags, they can increase their scores, making a more rewarding experience.
* Attendance Confirmation: Rather than intricate rating systems, MUNCH opts for a straightforward confirmation method for attendance, which is managed by classroom administrators.
